== 1.0.0 / 2010-12-08
* Switched indentation from 2 to 4 spaces :)
* Node.js compatibility improvements
* Remove magic booleans from sinon.assert.expose, replace with option object
* Put QUnit adapter in it's own repository
* Update build script to build standalone timers and server files
* Breaking change: thisObj -> thisValue
  Change brings consistency to the code-base, always use thisValue
* Add sinon.assert.pass callback for successful assertions
* Extract sandbox configuration from sinon.test

  Refactored sinon.test to not do all the heavy lifting in creating sandbox
  objects from sinon.config. Now sinon.sandbox.create accepts an optional
  configuration that can be retrieved through sinon.getConfig({ ... }) - or, to
  match previous behavior, through sinon.getConfig(sinon.config);
    
  The default configuration now lives in sinon.defaultConfig rather than the
  previous sinon.test.
    
  This change enables external tools, such as test framework adapters, to easily
  create configurable sandboxes without going through sinon.test
* Rewrite sinon.clock.tick to fix bug and make implementation clearer
* Test config load correct files
* Make timers and XHR truly standalone by splitting the IE work-around in two files
* Don't fail when comparing DOM elements in sinon.deepEqual (used in calledWith(...))
* Should mirror properties on Date when faking it
* Added and updated configuration for both JsLint and JavaScript lint
* [August Lilleaas]Â The build script can optionally build a file without the
  version name in it, by passing 'plain', i.e. './build plain'.

  Useful when using the build script to build and use sinon programatically, so
  one can 'cp path/to/sinon/pkg/sinon.js my/scripts/'
* [August Lilleaas] Checking and warning if we got a load error and rubygems
  isn't present.
* [August Lilleaas] Updating build script to be runnable from any
  directory. Current working directory doesn't have to be repo root.

== 0.8.0 / 2010-10-30
* sinon.wrapMethod no longer accepts faking already faked methods
* sinon-qunit 'plugin'
* sinon.test / sinon.config can now expose the sandbox object

== 0.7.2 / 2010-10-25
* Add sinon.sandbox.create back in
* Fix bug where clock.tick would fire timeouts in intervals when
  setInterval was also called

== 0.7.1 / 2010-10-16
* The fake server will now match paths against full URLs, meaning that
  server.respondWith("/", "OK"); will match requests for
  "http://currentHost/".
* Improved toString method for spies and stubs which leads to more
  precise error messages from sinon.assert.*

== 0.7.0 / 2010-09-19
* sinon.useFakeTimers now fakes the Date constructor by default
* sinon.testCase now fakes XHR and timers by default
* sinon.config controls the behavior of sinon.testCase
* Fixed bug in clock.tick - now fires timers in correct order
* Added the ability to tick a clock string for longer ticks.
  Passing a number causes the clock to tick the specified amount of
  milliseconds, passing a string like "12:32" ticks 12 minutes and 32
  seconds.
* calledBefore and calledAfter for individual calls
* New assertions
  sinon.assert.notCalled
  sinon.assert.calledOnce
  sinon.assert.calledTwice
  sinon.assert.calledThrice
* sinon.test now throws if passed anything other than a function
* sinon.testCase now throws if passed anything other than an object
* sinon.{spy,stub}(obj, method) now throws if the property is not an
  existing function - helps avoid perpetuating typo bugs
* Vastly improved error messages from assertions
* Spies/stubs/expectations can have their names resolved in many cases
* Removed feature where sinon.testCase allowed for nested test cases
  (does not belong in Sinon.JS)
* Organizational change: src/ becomes lib/ Helps npm compatibility
* Thanks to Cory Flanigan for help on npm compatibility

== 0.6.2 / 2010-08-12
* Fixed another bug in sinon.fakeServerWithClock where consecutive
  respond() calls did not trigger timeouts.

== 0.6.1 / 2010-08-12
* Fixed a bug in sinon.fakeServerWithClock where the clock was ticked
  before the server had responded to all requests, resulting in
  objects not having been responded to by the time the timeout ran.

== 0.6.0 / 2010-08-10
* FakeXMLHttpRequest
* sinon.useFakeXMLHttpRequest
* sinon.fakeServer
* sinon.fakeServerWithClock
* Improved fake timers implementation, made them work properly in IE 6-8
* Improved sinon.sandbox
  * Added useFakeServer
  * Added inject method
* Improved sinon.test method
  * Made configuration aware
  * Now uses sinon.sandbox in place of sinon.collection
* Changed default configuration for sinon.test, breaking compatibility
  with 0.5.0 - can be changed through sinon.config

== 0.5.0 / 2010-06-09
* Initial release
* Spies, stubs, mocks
* Assertions
* collections, test, testCase
* Fake timers (half-baked)
