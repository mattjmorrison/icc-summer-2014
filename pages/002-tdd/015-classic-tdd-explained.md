# TDD Explained

## Write a failing test (Red)

1. Write some code that will verify that some other code does what you want

    - It won't because that 'other code' does not yet exist

2. Execute that test code and verify that it fails (in the exact way that you expected it to fail)

    - A compile error counts as "Executing" that test code

3. When you see the failure that you expected, move onto the next step
